# Beans-Classification-using-Transferd-InceptionV3
This project is a demonstration of using transfer learning on the InceptionV3 model to classify images from the Beans Dataset.

## Overview
The Beans Dataset consists of 3 classes of beans: black, cranberry, and kidney. Each class has 70 images, for a total of 210 images. The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately classify new images of beans into their respective classes.


Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for training a new model. In this case, we're using the InceptionV3 model (ImageNet Weights), which has been pre-trained on millions of images from the ImageNet dataset.
